# Exploring Python Viewer States

Technology: I am going to learn about python viewer states in Houdini. If I have time, I will also learn how to make shelf tools in Houdini. 

Rationale: Based on user feedback, our team is prioritizing adding viewport interactions to our tool. To do this, we will need to get familiar with python viewer states. We'd also like to have more visual ways of selecting objects, like through shelf tools.
